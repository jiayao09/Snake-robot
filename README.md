# SUMMARY:
</br>
I created this snake structure robot after getting fresh inspiration from this three-Link spatial cylinder cam mechanism (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRnCQUViFRc). This mechanical action closely resembles how a snake moves. Since there is an increasing need for flexible, narrow robots that can carry out a variety of duties in unique situations, I started this project to develop a snake robot.



# CURRENT PROCESS:

## More detail for version 1 is in new branch:

## More detail for version 2 (Control-Algorithm) is in new branch:

I'm currently attempting to fix some 3D printing issues that I discovered with this barrel part. The solution is using various printing materials and utilizing Matlab to create an optimal curve (I haven't given up on this design yet). I created a brand-new "branch" to work on the control algorithm first as I awaited the print and design. (Check out my new branch)

## Version 3 (latest update):
I believe that a more effective method of controlling the robot is required based on the results of the second version. Following further research into snake motion, I believe we can add a structure to generate snake motion that is linear. I modified theÂ robot by including a part that simulates a snake's muscular contraction, as I demonstrate below.
