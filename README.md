UPDATE:
I'm currently attempting to fix some 3D printing issues that I discovered with this barrel part. The solution is using various printing materials and utilizing Matlab to create an optimal curve (I haven't given up on this design yet). I created a brand-new "branch" to work on the control algorithm first as I awaited the print and design.
