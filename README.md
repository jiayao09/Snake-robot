## Version 3:
I believe that a more effective method of controlling the robot is required based on the results of the second version. Following further research into snake motion, I believe we can add a structure to generate snake motion that is linear. I modified the robot by including a part that simulates a snake's muscular contraction, as I demonstrate below.

This is a brief movie about snake muscle activity of rectilinear locomotion.  Visit this link to view the complete video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwHkAMo-Mj0

I think this structure can simulate the movement of the snake very well, but I am facing a problem that the range of his movement is too small. I am now considering to increase the longitudinal movement to increase the friction between the snake and the ground.Also consider combining version1 and version2 on this structure.
