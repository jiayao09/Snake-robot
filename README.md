# SUMMARY:
</br>
I created this snake structure robot after getting fresh inspiration from this three-Link spatial cylinder cam mechanism (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRnCQUViFRc). This mechanical action closely resembles how a snake moves. Since there is an increasing need for flexible, narrow robots that can carry out a variety of duties in unique situations, I started this project to develop a snake robot.



# CURRENT PROCESS:

## 08/17: Version 1 of the design

###### Problem for Version 1:

## 08/25: Version 2 of the design

New rod design: Added c clip to avoid slippage and key to retain barrel movement

To create a vertical movement, add the front portion. modifying a few of the issues I mentioned above:

###### Problem for Version 2:
  - The tolerance for 3D printer (try out on Ultimaker and Formlabs in 3 different material) is difficult to control. Instead of using separate rods, which make assembly more difficult, consider about designing everything into a single element.
  - Change the pin that connects the two components.
  - Transform the select motor into a speed reduction  gear motor.


## 09/01: Version 3 of the design

UPDATE:
I'm currently attempting to fix some 3D printing issues that I discovered with this barrel part. The solution is using various printing materials and utilizing Matlab to create an optimal curve (I haven't given up on this design yet). I created a brand-new "branch" to work on the control algorithm first as I awaited the print and design.
